# How to run the project

This project is made in two different languages, through python(Working) and React/JavaScript (Having some problems)
The python project is working and will do what the developer test wants to accomplish.
JavaScript version is almost functional, but i am struggling to get through the CORS-error, so this needs more work.

## To run the python project

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## To run the  JavaScript project

```
npm install
```

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
